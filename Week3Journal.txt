Today we spoke about a numerous amount of subjects ,
namely the use of arithmetic operators .
Ive learnt more use of the increment and decrement operator.
The small detail that most would or could miss was the adding
the increment or decrement before or after the number to 
change the outcome based on if you are looking after or before the
number (--8) would return 7 in a console log but (8--) would return 
8 and then decrement the number to 7. After this the other thing I 
was not sure on was the for loop , ive personally touched on this but
today gave me a firmer understanding of this use of code.
Ive decided to change and try different alternatives to these 
examples and keep the understanding of this new found knowledge
stronger in my mind.
